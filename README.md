# Baby Data

This is a repo that I am using to monitor my baby's eating and sleep cycles. 

# Goal

The vision is to eventually have handwritten notes landing in my on-prem Minio server trigger OCR and ETL pipelines to capture incoming data in useful transformations/views for the dashboard. 

# Services

- UI: streamlit frontend
- OCR: an OCR framework to ingest images of input data from handwritten notes (Work in Progress)
